Styling a biography page :
With the things you have learned in the last few lessons you should find that you can format simple text documents using CSS to add your own style to them. This assessment gives you a chance to do that.

Prerequistites : Before attempting this assessment you should have alreay worked through all the article in this module, and also have an understanding of HTML basics (stdy Introudction to HTML).
Objective : To have a play with some CSS and test your new-found knowledge.

Starting point :
You can work in the live editor below, or you can download the starting point file. to work with in your own editor . This is a singel page containing both the HTML and the styarting point CSS (in the head of the document) if you prefere you could move this CSS to a separte file and link to the when you can create the example on your lcoal computer.

Alternatively use an online tool such as CodePen, jsFiddle, or Glitch to work on the task.

Note : if you get stuck , then ask us for help -- see the Assessment or further help section at the bottom of this page.
Project brief :
The following live example shows a biography, which has been styled using CSS. The CSS properties that are used are as foolows - each one links to its property page on MDN, whcih will give you more examples of its use.

-> font-family
->color
->border-bottom
-> font-weight
-> font-size
-> font-style
->text-decoration

In the interactive editor you will find some CSS alreay in place. This selects parts of the documetn usign elemetn selectors, classes and pseudo-classes. Mkae the followin chagnes to this CSS:
1. Make the level one heading pink, using the CSS keyword hotpink.
2. Give the heading a 10px dotted border-bottom which uses the CSS color keyword purple.
3. Make the level 2 heading italic.
4. Give the ul used for the contanct details a background-color of #eeeee, and a 5px solid purple border. Use some padding to push the content away from the border.
5. Make the links green on hover.

Hints and tips :
-> Use the W3C CSS validator to catch unitented mistakes in your CSS - mistakes you might have otherwise missed - so that you can fix them.
-> Afterwards try looking up some properties not mentioned on this in the MDN CSS referesence and get adventurous!
-> Remember that there is no wrong ansere here - at this stage in your learning you afford to have a bit of fun.

Example :
You should end up with something like this image.
Assessment of further help :
If you would like your work assessed or are stuck and want to ask for help:
1. Put your work into an online shareable editor such as CodePen, jsFiddle, or Glitch.
2. Write a post asking for assessment and / or help at the MDN Discorse form Learning category.
You post should include:
-> A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for Styling a biography page"
_> Details of thwat you have already tried and what you would like us to do; for example, tell use if you're stuck and need help or wanted an assessment.
-> A link to the example you want assessed or need help with , in an online sharable editor (as mention in step 1 above). This is good practice to get into - it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.
-> A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.
